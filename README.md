## Feature Breakdown
### 1. User Management

- This feature handles all user-related functionality, including registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures secure access using JWT authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their personal details and booking history.

## 2. Property Management

Hosts can list, edit, and delete their properties through this module. Each property includes details such as title, description, location, price, images, and amenities. This feature makes it easy for property owners to manage their listings efficiently.

## 3. Booking System

This feature enables users to reserve available properties for specific dates. It includes date selection, price calculation, and confirmation of reservations. Each booking links the user to a property, creating a unique transaction record that tracks availability and prevents double-booking.

## 4. Payment Integration

The payment feature allows users to securely pay for their bookings using integrated payment gateways. It tracks transaction status, ensures data encryption, and provides receipts for each confirmed booking. This adds trust and financial accountability to the platform.

## 5. Review and Rating System

After completing a stay, users can leave reviews and rate properties based on their experience. This feature helps maintain transparency and trust, allowing future guests to make informed decisions based on previous feedback.

## 6. Search and Filtering

Users can search for properties using filters such as location, price range, amenities, and ratings. This feature improves user experience by helping them quickly find listings that match their preferences and budget.

## 7. Responsive UI/UX

The frontend design ensures the platform works seamlessly across devices ‚Äî desktop, tablet, and mobile. This feature prioritizes accessibility, speed, and usability, making navigation simple and enjoyable for all users.

## API Security
### 1. Authentication

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to verify user identities before granting access to protected routes. Each token is unique to a user session and prevents unauthorized access. This ensures that only verified users can perform sensitive operations like booking a property or managing listings.

### 2. Authorization

After authentication, role-based authorization ensures that users can only access resources that match their permissions. For example, guests can make bookings, while hosts can add or edit property listings. This separation of privileges helps maintain data integrity and prevents misuse of the system.

### 3. Rate Limiting

To prevent API abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, rate limiting is implemented. It restricts the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a specific time frame, protecting the system from overload and ensuring fair usage among all users.

### 4. Data Encryption

Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details are encrypted both in transit and at rest. Using HTTPS (SSL/TLS) ensures secure data transfer, while encryption algorithms protect information stored in the database. This prevents unauthorized access even if data is intercepted or breached.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization

All API inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). This ensures that the backend processes only safe and properly formatted data.

### 6. Secure Payment Handling

Payment endpoints are integrated with secure, third-party gateways that follow PCI-DSS compliance standards. This adds an extra layer of protection for financial transactions and user payment information.

### Why API Security is Crucial

- Protecting User Data: Prevents unauthorized access to personal details like emails, passwords, and addresses.

- Securing Financial Transactions: Ensures that all payment-related activities remain private and tamper-proof.

- Maintaining System Reliability: Reduces downtime and safeguards the platform from attacks or data corruption.

- Building User Trust: A secure application increases confidence and encourages long-term platform use.

## CI/CD Pipeline
### 1. What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying applications. It ensures that code changes are automatically integrated, tested, and delivered to production efficiently and reliably.

### 2. Importance of CI/CD in This Project

Implementing CI/CD in the Airbnb Clone project improves development speed, collaboration, and product reliability.

Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically tests and integrates new code changes into the main branch to catch bugs early.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Ensures new features and fixes are quickly and safely deployed to production without manual intervention.
Together, they reduce errors, maintain consistent code quality, and provide a smooth user experience during updates.

### 3. Tools Used

GitHub Actions: Automates workflows such as running tests, linting, and deploying code directly from the repository.

Docker: Provides consistent development and deployment environments through containerization.

Docker Compose: Simplifies managing multi-service environments like frontend, backend, and database containers.

CI/CD Pipeline Example:

Developer pushes code to GitHub ‚Üí

GitHub Actions runs tests automatically ‚Üí

If all tests pass, Docker builds the image ‚Üí

The new version is deployed to the server or cloud environment.

### 4. Benefits
